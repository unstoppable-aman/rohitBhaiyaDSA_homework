Given an array a[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1, you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array. 
Return the answer in ascending order.

Note: The extra space is only for the array to be returned.
Try and perform all operations within the provided array. 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
a[] = {0,3,1,2}
Output: -1
Explanation: N=4 and all elements from 0
to (N-1 = 3) are present in the given
array. Therefore output is -1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
a[] = {2,3,1,2,3}
Output: 2 3 
Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once
in the given array.


SOLUTION:

 vector<int> duplicates(int arr[], int n) {
       vector<int> vec;
       int count[n]={0},hasDuplicate=0;;
       
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
           count[arr[i]]++;
       }
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
           if(count[i]>1){
            vec.push_back(i);
            hasDuplicate=1;
           }
       }
       if(!hasDuplicate) vec.push_back(-1);
       return vec;
    }
